# Explaining What the WSR Test Does (Mathematically) #
######################################################

# In short, the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test functions as a way to not test the means of two samples, but instead, their median.
# Mathematically, the Signed-Rank Test two for samples becomes the Signed-Rank Test for one sample, because we end up testing the Difference Score.

# With small datasets, this is actually an extremely easy test to calculate by hand. 
# The test has 5 steps: 
# 1. Calculate absolute value of differences
# 2. Rank these differences (small to large)
# 3. Reattach sign of difference
# 4. sum values for positive (W+) and negative (W-) differences
# 5. Assign test statistic as larger of W+ and W- for nondirectional HA.

# We'll first just walk through exactly what is occurring in this analysis, and then after that, get into the code.

library(PairedData) # This provides us with the example data used in these Notes.
data(Tobacco)
head(Tobacco)
# This dataset presents 8 paired data corresponding to numbers of lesions 
# caused by two virus preparations inoculated into the two halves of 
# each tobacco leaves.

# Remember, if you want to see what happens at any stage, simply start
# at the top of this chunk of code, and select everything until right before a |>.
# Copy, paste, and run that code, and see what the output is. 

Tobacco |> 
  mutate(
    Prep_Diff = Preparation_2-Preparation_1, # First, the difference scores are calculated.
    AbsDiff = abs(Prep_Diff) # 1. Calculate the absolute value of differences.
  ) |>
  dplyr::select(Prep_Diff, AbsDiff) |>
  arrange(AbsDiff) |> # Then, we order these differences by their absolute value, from lowest difference score to highest.
  mutate(
    Rank = rank(AbsDiff), # 2. We then assign these absolute values a rank, where ties get averaged.
    SignedRank = Rank*sign(Prep_Diff), # 3. We then reattach the sign of differences.
    PosNeg = sign(Prep_Diff) # The next step wants us to sum both the positive | negative values, so we create a var to help.
  ) |>
  group_by(PosNeg) |>
  summarise(
    sumrankedvalues = sum(SignedRank) # 4. sum values for positive (W+) and negative (W-) differences (see group_by() doing that second part.)
  ) |>
  dplyr::select(sumrankedvalues) |> 
  abs() |>
  max() # 5. Assign test statistic as larger of W+ and W- for nondirectional HA.

# The test statistic ends up being 34, which, as you will see below, is exactly what wilcox.test() tells us is the V (34)!
  
############
# mutate() #
############

# mutate() is part of the tidyverse library and it mutates the dataframe to 
# create new variables. Below, we make a variable called Prep_Diff, and importantly,
# we overwrite our Tobacco data. You could of course make this Tobacco2, but 
# why have two datasets of the same thing, just one without one variable?

Tobacco <- Tobacco |>
  mutate(
    Prep_Diff = Preparation_2-Preparation_1
  )

# If you had multiple new variables, simply add a comma after the expression,
# so it looks like:
# mutate(
# NewVar1 = expressiontocreateit, 
# NewVar2 = expressiontocreateit, 
# NewVar3 = expressiontocreateit
# )

# And be sure the last one has no comma. 

##########
# pull() #
##########

# pull() is a verb within the tidyverse, much like select() and mutate().
# It acts as a $ -- if you do data |> pull(variable), it is many times equivalent 
# to the idea of writing data$variable . 

# This one we acknowledge might be where our piping starts to get a bit... excessive.
# Both authors admit we would be much more likely to at this point use data$variable.

# Still, practice makes perfect, and readability matters!

Tobacco |> 
  pull(Prep_Diff) |>
  mean()

# is equivalent to

mean(Tobacco$Prep_Diff)

# We used pull() a lot in this lesson, so you can see other applications.
# Remember, if you would like, you always can default to data$variable.

##################
# shapiro_test() #
##################
#library(rstatix)
# Paired samples want to examine the difference variable when considering if there is non-normality.

Tobacco |>
  rstatix::shapiro_test(Prep_Diff)

# This dataset is actually totally fine to use as a paired t-test, but if you found it p<.05, 
# it's a flag that maybe you should consider Wilcoxon! There's more to test of course than just this.

# The things to remember about Shapiro Wilk is that it has low power when N is small.
# (It will struggle to detect a true effect if the effect does exist).

# But it becomes hyper sensitive (Inflated Type I Error Rate) when N is large.

##############
#  geom_qq() #
# in ggplot2 #
##############

Tobacco |>
  ggplot(aes(sample = Prep_Diff)) +
  geom_qq() +  # This plots the observed 
  geom_qq_line() # 

# The line represents where the observations should fall if they were distributed on 
# a normal distribution. Basically, it plots the quantiles of the actual data against
# what the data of a theoretical normally distributed quantile.

# Notice for this example, 7 of the observations are very close to the line. 
# This is pretty good and another reason why for this data, we seem to be okay
# with proceeding with a paired t-test.

##########
# hist() #
##########

Tobacco |>
  pull(Prep_Diff) |>
  hist()

# The histogram shows a pretty good looking normal-ish distribution. It's not 
# perfect by any means, but we have small samples, so we don't expect it to.

#################
# wilcox.test() #
#################
library(stats)
Tobacco |>
  wilcox.test(Pair(Preparation_1, Preparation_2) ~ 1, data=_)
# Things to notice:
# 1. We utilize Pair() to tie the two columns together as paired data.
# 2. We use ~ 1 to test it against an empty comparison. Because we have provided 
# Pairs, it tells the function that it should be a paired test.

# Therefore, this takes:
# Wide data (each variable should be a column).
# Pair() should wrap the two variables on the left hand side of the ~.

###################
# rank_biserial() #
###################
library(effectsize)
Tobacco |>
  rank_biserial(Pair(Preparation_1, Preparation_2) ~ 1, data=_)
# It is worth noting that we have yet to find another rank-biserial correlation effect-size function.

# All notes repeat for this, except this function comes from the effectsize library.

# interpret() #
###############
#library(effectsize)
Tobacco |>
  rank_biserial(Pair(Preparation_1, Preparation_2) ~ 1, data=_) |>
  interpret(rules="cohen1988")
# This provides an additional column based on Cohen's cutoff points for effect sizes.
# You don't need this at all - it's easy enough to look at the effect size and be able
# to tell on your own, but if you couldn't remember what they were, this would be sufficient.

# You can dig into the documentation to find their rules and options-- 
vignette("interpret", "effectsize")

# Where the correlation coefficient effect sizes for Cohen 1988 are reported as:
# r <.1 - Very small
# .1 <= r < .3  - Small
# .3 <= r < .5 - Moderate
# >=.5 - Large


#######################
# Getting the Z Score #
#######################

# Many times, papers report the Z statistic instead of the V or W that R outputs.
# It is straightforward to calculate the Z - it is simply just part of the p value.

# Given a Wilcox.Test, save it.
testoutput <- Tobacco |>
  wilcox.test(Pair(Preparation_1, Preparation_2) ~ 1, data=_)

# Pass the p.value variable of the new object
testoutput$p.value

# Into qnorm and divide by two.
qnorm(testoutput$p.value/2)


#################
# Other Methods #

# A Deeper Exploration #

#     And Using %$%    #
########################
# We have used |> as the base, default pipe throughout this course. And, we believe
# it is pedagogically useful (and future-forward thinking) to keep this in place.

# However, the |> comes from %>%, which is drawn from the individuals who created the tidyverse.

# There is small functionality in the differences between |> and %>%, and truly, 
# at this point of writing, %>% still has a few side-uses. Note: We use data=_, 
# but %>% requires us to say data=., (a period instead of an underscore).

# This then takes us one step further - the singular pipe focuses on passing one object --
# be it a dataset, a column, a row.

# But above - we've been trying to deal with two columns. Time 1 and Time 2.

# There is other versions of the pipe -- all housed in magrittr

# Fix the following script.
# Notice the order and memorize it. 
# Take our dataset (df) , and then
# group it by our explanatory variable (condition), and then
# Summarise this dataset by
# Creating a new variable in this summary dataset called Mean
# Mean takes the mean of our Response variable, and ignores NA.
# Repeat for standard deviation.
# I have done the N one for you.
# Finally, we have to create a column called SE, or standard error.
# Standard error is calculated as SD/sqrt(N). 

# When you think it is a complete, save the script. The name of the script
# above will go from red to black. That is how you know you've saved it.
# You can use ctrl+S to save, or click the floppy disk above.

sum_moral <- 
  NameOfDataSet |>  #Change this to concealed

    SD = sd(ResponseVariable, na.rm=TRUE), #Change this to moral

# If you were to type your new dataset into your console, sum_data,

- Class: text
  Output: This module will be relatively short, but you should consider taking the Independent Samples T-Test module and Levene's Test section first. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: As a reminder, the assumptions of the independent samples t-test are as follows-
  
- Class: text
  Output: (1) Independence of observations. Each subject should only belong to one group. 

- Class: text
  Output: (2) Random samples. Both samples must be randomly sampled from the population.

- Class: text
  Output: (3) Normal distribution. The response variable is normally distributed between each population.
  
- Class: text
  Output: (4) Equivalence of variances. The standard deviation of the distribution is equal in both populations. 

- Class: text
  Output: This module will focus on the 4th assumption - that the variances between the groups are equal. In particular, what happens when we cannot meet that assumption?

- Class: figure
  Output: If our two groups have unequal variances, we must turn to a Welch's T-Test. While the independent samples t-test uses a pooled variance in SE, Welch uses each group's variance in the equation, weighting each by the number of observations per group.

- Class: figure
  Output: We also punish ourselves for having unequal variances by changing how we calculate degrees of freedom. If you see a decimal point degrees of freedom, it may suggest that the researchers have somehow tried to account for unequal variances. As you can see to the right, the equation is pretty long.

- Class: text
  Output: To understand this test, working through an example is important.

- Class: text
  Output: "Researchers wanted to test if there was a difference in perception between individuals who conceal an identity compared to those who disclose an identity."

- Class: text
  Output: They write - "After being informed that they would be introduced to a person named 'S' participants in the concealment condition read- 'S holds an identity. Other people do not know  that S holds this identity because S conceals it from them.” In the disclosure condition, participants read- “S holds an identity. Other people know that S   holds this identity because S discloses it to them."

- Class: text
  Output: They then had participants rate S on a series of questions, including their morality and sociability.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The data is loaded into your environment as concealed. Let's view it now by piping (|>) concealed into head().
  CorrectAnswer: concealed |> head()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='concealed |> head()')
  Hint: concealed |> head()

- Class: text
  Output: The authors write - "A Welch two-sample t-test was conducted to test the effect of condition on perceptions of morality. Participants viewed the target who concealed as less moral (M = 1.74, SE = 0.08) than the target who disclosed (M = 3.49, SE = 0.09; t(404.41) = 14.54, p < .001, d = 1.39; see Fig. 1 for all Study 1 results)."
  
- Class: text
  Output: Prior, they wrote, "Homogeneity of variance was assessed for each model prior to analysis. Student’s t-tests were computed where that assumption was met, and Welch's t-tests were conducted where it was not."

- Class: text
  Output: Thus, the authors suggest that the variances of perceptions of morality are not equal between the groups. How can we test that? 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's use the levene_test() function from the rstatix package to do this. Start by piping (|>) your dataset (concealed) into levene_test(). The equation will take a single argument, which will be moral ~ condition. Try that now. 
  CorrectAnswer: concealed |> levene_test(moral~condition)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='concealed |> levene_test(moral~condition)')
  Hint: concealed |> levene_test(moral~condition)

- Class: text
  Output: Great job. We can see that the null hypothesis of the homogeneity of variances between the two groups is rejected, suggesting that they do not have equal variances. 
  
- Class: figure
  Output: We can see a bit of these variances in this violin plot.

- Class: text
  Output: Now that we have shown the unequal variances, we can use Welch's T-Test. The great thing about Welch's Two two-sample t-test is that it is the default t-test in R. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's run a Welch's t-test on the data, seeing if concealing a hidden identity changes perceptions of morality. Take our data, concealed, and pipe it (|>) into the t.test() function. Pass that function three arguments, moral~condition, data=_, and var.equal=FALSE.
  CorrectAnswer: concealed |> t.test(moral~condition, data=_, var.equal=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='concealed |> t.test(moral~condition, data=_, var.equal=FALSE)')
  Hint: concealed |> t.test(moral~condition, data=_, var.equal=FALSE)

- Class: text
  Output: A vital part that makes this the degrees of freedom of the t-test decimals. While dfs are commonly N minus some number, Welch's t-test generally creates fractional degrees of freedom and makes them smaller by quite a bit (consider that an ordinary t-test would have df=437)!


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Scroll back up to your t-test, but this time, delete the argument in t.test() that said var.equal=FALSE. 
  CorrectAnswer: concealed |> t.test(moral~condition, data=_)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='concealed |> t.test(moral~condition, data=_)')
  Hint: concealed |> t.test(moral~condition, data=_)

- Class: text
  Output: The exact output was given! That's because R uses Welch's T-test as the default.

- Class: script
  Output: The next part of their sentence called out the means and standard errors. Let's calculate those now. 
  AnswerTests: script_results_identical('sum_moral')
  Hint: Follow the notes in the script, and be sure you saved your script (using the save button or ctrl+S) before typing submit() in the Console.
  Script: summarise.R

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Print out the results of your script in the console now by typing in sum_moral. 
  CorrectAnswer: sum_moral
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sum_moral')
  Hint: Type sum_moral.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Finally, we can also get the effect size they report. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To get their effect size, we need to use a new function, and we will pipe (|>) our data (concealed) into it.  In the lsr library, there is a function called cohensD(). It takes at least two inputs- the formula (moral ~ condition) and the data (for us because we are piping, remember data=_). Let's try just those two inputs now.
  CorrectAnswer: concealed |> cohensD(moral~condition, data=_)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='concealed |> cohensD(moral~condition, data=_)')
  Hint: concealed |> cohensD(moral~condition, data=_)

- Class: text
  Output: We want to explain why R uses Welch's as the default. The general argument is that it loses very little power (the ability to detect an effect if an effect does exist) if the variances are equal (i.e., you could use Student's t-test) (c.f., Delacre, Lakens, & Leys, 2017) - they go as far as to say run Welch's without considering equal variances at all. 

- Class: text
  Output: The strength of a Student's T-Test only shines if the Ns of the smaller group are severely small (N<=5) (de Winter, 2013). 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Since we rarely have a study with groups as small as 5, it seems best practice to use Welch's as the default, mainly due to a minimal loss of power.

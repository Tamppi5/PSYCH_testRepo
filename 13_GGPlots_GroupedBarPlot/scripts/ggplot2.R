  # Next up, let's set the y axis to be correct. 
  # The ggplot2 fn scale_y_continuous() can help us here.
  # We should pass it two arguments.
    # The first, breaks, will equal seq(-.80, .60, 0.2)
      # That means we want to have breaks from -.8 to .6 every 0.2. 
    # The second, labels, will equal number_format(accuracy = 0.01) 
      # This will round our y axis text to 2 decimal points. 

  # After you've done that, add from scale_y_continuous()+ to another layer.
  # this will be expand_limits(). expand limits will expand the ggplot area.
  # we want expand_limits() to take one argument, y=c(-.80, .60) for the limits of the plot.

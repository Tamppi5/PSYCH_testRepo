  # You're doing great. Let's clean up a few more pieces.
  # The y axis label, ylab(), should be "Wise Reasoning" as the argument.
  # The x axis label, xlab(), should be "", because there isn't one.
  
  # R hasn't given us a x axis line at zero.
  # We can add horizontal lines using geom_hline().
    # geom_hline() needs at least one argument, yintercept, which we want equal to 0.
    # We'll also add a second argument to geom_hline to reduce the linewidth, setting linewidth = 0.3 .

  # And finally, there's a tiny line between the two targets.
  # We can add a geom_segment() to draw that line. We need 5 arguments
  # It needs to know where it begins on the x axis (x=1.5) and where it ends (xend=1.5)
  # It needs to know where it begins on the y axis (y=0) and where it ends (yend=-.02)
  # Finally, let's make the linewidth really small, linewidth=.2

# Mauchly's Test #
# for Sphericity #
##################

# Look for any p<.05
# Note that Sphericity can only be violated if the levels > 2.
# Since this example there's only two treatments, it does not show up (it can't be violated).

# Since it is significant, we should correct.
# We look at GGe for Time and HEe for Time. If either is less than .75, we should use GG.
# Since both are less than .75, we should correct with GG corrections.

# The corrections adjust the degrees of freedom, which will adjust the F Critical.
# It makes it harder to reject the null.

# Partial Eta Squared #
#######################
library(apaTables)
# Given F.value, df1, df2, and a conf.level, you can get a partial eta squared.

#####################
# Repeated Measures #
# As Random Effects #
#####################
# There is a second method to do repeated measures.
# This method cannot adjust for sphericity, but does provide output that can be:
# (a) tested using pairwise comparisons
# (b) plotted easily as estimated marginal means.
# You just treat the subject as a random effect.
# Everything that we learned in One Way ANOVA [Between] then applies for coding purposes.

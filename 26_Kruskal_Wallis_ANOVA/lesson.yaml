- Class: text
  Output: The Kruskal-Wallis test is a nonparametric test based on rankings. It is the Mann-Whitney U-Test expanded beyond two groups and is the non-parametric alternative to an ANOVA. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Take the Testing NonNormality module to learn how to test this assumption. For now, we will assume that the authors were correct in their assumption testing and that a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was the right approach.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Since it is the Mann-Whitney expanded, it carries the same assumptions. We still have to assume that all groups are random samples from their own populations and the distribution of the variable has the same shape in every population.
  
- Class: text
  Output: It also has very little power with small sample sizes but has roughly equivalent power to an ANOVA with large sample sizes.
  
- Class: text
  Output: The null hypothesis of the Mann-Whitney test and the Kruskal-Wallis is that the mean rank of the groups are the same. 

- Class: text
  Output: If the distributions of the groups are similar (as noted as one of our assumptions), then we can make the additional claim that the medians of the groups are the same as our null hypothesis. However, this assumption does suggest that the only difference is a shift of the distributions, and additive shifts in distributions effect the mean as much as they effect the median, so a claim could be made that this is testing a difference in means as well.

  Output: "We are going to analyze data published in PLoS One. In this paper, they investigated whether or not the ominous background music often accompanies shark footage in documentaries impacts an individual's perceptions of sharks. Their data showed that participants rated sharks more negatively and less positively after viewing a 60-second video clip of swimming sharks set to ominous background music, compared to participants who watched the same video clip set to uplifting background music or silence. Attitudes toward sharks did not differ among participants assigned to audio-only control treatments."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We've loaded the data into your environment called Sharks. Let's look at it by piping Sharks into head().
  CorrectAnswer: Sharks |> head()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Sharks |> head()')
  Hint: Try Sharks |> head(). 

- Class: text
  Output: Notice there are three factor columns - one that lumps all conditions together (Condition) and one that treats each actual factor as its column (AudioVideo and MusicChoice). 
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which column represents whether or not the participants were in the Video or Audio condition?
  AnswerChoices: Condition; AudioVideo; MusicChoice; PositiveRatings; NegativeRatings
  CorrectAnswer: AudioVideo
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='AudioVideo')
  Hint: Which one sounds like it represents the Audio or Video condition?
  
- Class: text
  Output: While in our Two-Way ANOVAs, we want both AudioVideo and MusicChoice, Kruskal-Wallis doesn't appreciate interaction terms in the same way, and therefore, we want all of the conditions to be a single column (Condition). 
  
- Class: text
  Output: The authors write - "There was a significant effect of experimental treatment on... negative (Kruskal-Wallis H = 62.423, df = 5, p < 0.001) ... ratings of  sharks."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To check their answer, we will pipe (|>) our dataset, Sharks, into kruskal_test() from the rstatix package, where we will pass the equation NegativeRatings ~ Condition .
  CorrectAnswer: Sharks |> kruskal_test(NegativeRatings ~ Condition)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Sharks |> kruskal_test(NegativeRatings ~ Condition)')
  Hint: Try Sharks |> kruskal_test(NegativeRatings ~ Condition) . Did you forget the s in NegativeRatings?

- Class: text
  Output: Great job. We can see the H=62.423, the df=5, and the p<.001.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Next, they write - "Participants in the V-ominous treatment rated sharks significantly more negatively  (M = 5.07) than those in the V-uplifting (M = 4.33; Dunn’s Z = 2.993, Bonferroni-adjusted  p = 0.042) and V-silence treatments (M = 4.43; Z = 3.023, p = 0.038)."

- Class: script
  Output: Let's tackle the means first. We've loaded a script to get the output. Notice that it says V-ominous and V-uplifting, suggesting Video conditions.
  AnswerTests: mean_results_identical('vidmeans')
  Hint: vidmeans <- Sharks |>  filter(AudioVideo=="Video") |> group_by(Condition) |> summarise(mean = mean(NegativeRatings, na.rm=TRUE)) should get it for you!
  Script: mean.R

#18
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's see your output by typing vidmeans now.
  CorrectAnswer: vidmeans
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='vidmeans')
  Hint: Try typing vidmeans into your console.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Great. The second half of that sentence talked about some Dunn's Z value. Dunn's Test is a post-hoc test for ranked data, generally used after one does a Kruskal-Wallis test. We can call it by piping Sharks into dunn_test() with two arguments, our equation of NegativeRatings ~ Condition, and p.adjust.method="bonferroni", since the authors mention correcting for multiple comparisons. Since there are six groups, the possible comparisons grow quite large -- 15 total (5+4+3+2+1).
  CorrectAnswer: Sharks |> dunn_test(NegativeRatings~Condition, p.adjust.method="bonferroni") 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Sharks |> dunn_test(NegativeRatings~Condition, p.adjust.method="bonferroni") ')
  Hint: Try Sharks |> dunn_test(NegativeRatings~Condition, p.adjust.method="bonferroni") . 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Something nice to notice about rstatix is that it does output in "A tibble" when possible. This means we can do tidy verbs onto it. That first column is not helpful for us - we know it's NegativeRatings. Hit up on your keyboard, and at the end of your dunn_test(), pipe (|>) that through select(), where we will unselect .y.  using the dash (-.y.).
  CorrectAnswer: Sharks |> dunn_test(NegativeRatings~Condition, p.adjust.method="bonferroni") |> select(-.y.)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Sharks |> dunn_test(NegativeRatings~Condition, p.adjust.method="bonferroni")  |> select(-.y.)')
  Hint: Try Sharks |> dunn_test(NegativeRatings~Condition, p.adjust.method="bonferroni") |> select(-.y.). 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: That's still a lot - so let's take this one step further. At the end, let's pipe this one more time into filter(). We will pass another function into filter(), called str_detect() in the stringr package, which will take two arguments. The first is the column we're looking at, which will be group1, and the second, which will be the pattern of the string we're looking for, which will be "V." in quotes. Try that now. 
  CorrectAnswer: Sharks |> dunn_test(NegativeRatings~Condition, p.adjust.method="bonferroni") |> select(-.y.) |> filter(str_detect(group1, "V."))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Sharks |> dunn_test(NegativeRatings~Condition, p.adjust.method="bonferroni")  |> select(-.y.) |> filter(str_detect(group1, "V."))')
  Hint: Try Sharks |> dunn_test(NegativeRatings~Condition, p.adjust.method="bonferroni") |> select(-.y.)  |> filter(str_detect(group1, "V.")) 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Great job. The text read - "Participants in the V-ominous treatment rated sharks significantly more negatively  (M = 5.07) than those in the V-uplifting (M = 4.33; Dunn’s Z = 2.993, Bonferroni-adjusted  p = 0.042) and V-silence treatments (M = 4.43; Z = 3.023, p = 0.038)."  Which comparison reported does our statistics disagree with - that is, which one of these comparisons is different from the text?
  AnswerChoices: V. Silence vs. V. Ominous; V. Uplifting vs. V. Silence; V. Uplifting vs. V. Ominous
  CorrectAnswer: V. Uplifting vs. V. Ominous
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='V. Uplifting vs. V. Ominous')
  Hint: Which one does not have the same Dunn's Z or p-value?
  
- Class: text
  Output: We're not sure either since our means were correct. We imagine it was a minor typographical error on the author's part - something that happens quite a bit! This is the joy of having open data; we can always double-check the work of others, and we all learn from it.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, while they don't do it in this paper, we also can report the effect size of this test using kruskal_effsize(). Scroll up using the up key on your keyboard until you find your kruskal_test() answer, and then instead, do kruskal_effsize().
  CorrectAnswer: Sharks |> kruskal_effsize(NegativeRatings ~ Condition)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Sharks |> kruskal_effsize(NegativeRatings ~ Condition)')
  Hint: Try Sharks |> kruskal_effsize(NegativeRatings ~ Condition) . Maybe you forgot the s in NegativeRatings?

- Class: text
  Output: Great job. The help file states that magnitude is defined as .01-.05 as a small effect, .06-.13 as a medium effect, and .14 and higher as a large effect for partial eta-squared (see Cohen, 1988). However effect size classifications like these need to be considered in context.

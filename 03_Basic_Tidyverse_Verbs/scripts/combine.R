# Let's combine everything we've learned so far.

# Create a new object called length.table that will be assigned (<-) the following:
# Take your data (data) and then 
#  filter() where Sepal.Width is less than 2.5 and then
#  filter() where Species does not equal (!=) "setosa" and then 
#  select() Species, Sepal.Length and then
#  use the table() function. 


# If done properly, if you were to print out your end result length.table in your
# console, it should look something like this:

#             Sepal.Length
# Species       4.9   5   5.5   6     6.2   6.3
### setosa      0     0     0   0       0     0
### versicolor  1     2     3   1       1     1
### virginica   0     0     0   1       0     0

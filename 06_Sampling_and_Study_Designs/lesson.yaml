- Class: text
  Output: Two key terms we will discuss is random sampling and random assignment.

- Class: text
  Output: Random sampling is selection from the population - we try our best to get a representative and random sample so that we can truly generalize our results to the population.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Random sampling would be an asset to
  AnswerChoices: External Validity;Internal Validity;Reliability;Floor Effects
  CorrectAnswer: External Validity
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='External Validity')
  Hint: It ensures that our results are generalizable. When we take care about generalizability outside of our test case, we are focusing on which type of validity?

- Class: text
  Output: Random assignment is talking specifically about conditions. If we have a drug and a placebo pill, we would want to make sure that participants are randomly assigned to either drug or placeabo - that we aren't consciously or unconsciously putting all men into drug and all women into placeabo.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Random assignment would be an asset to
  AnswerChoices: External Validity;Internal Validity;Reliability;Floor Effects
  CorrectAnswer: Internal Validity
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Internal Validity')
  Hint: It ensures that our study controls for all possible confounds. In the above example, we might not be able to tell if it was the drug, or simply a gender difference. When we care about the internal workings of a study, what kind of validity are we trying to protect?

- Class: text
  Output: Random sampling - giving everyone an equal shot of participating - is important. It can help reduce a biased sample.
  
- Class: text
  Output: One very often talked about biased sample is what we usually have in Psychology studies - Psychology undergraduates. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: We call them WEIRD Samples - western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic samples. We try and generalize about the world, but are we really, or are we just generalizing about western democratically raised students?

  Output: "The same holds true for Human-Computer Interaction. https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3411764.3445488"

- Class: text
  Output: The next thing is random assignment. This refers to our study design. There are three main study designs we will talk about.
  
- Class: text
  Output: There is between-subjects, within-subjects, and mixed design (when we use both within and between).

- Class: text
  Output: We'll start with between subjects. Between Subjects means that each subject is exposed to only one possible condition.
  
- Class: text
  Output: If you notice key words such as 'some participants received...' or 'half of the participants' or 'participants were separated by...' - these are all clues that it is a between subjects design.
  
- Class: text
  Output: In the real world, there are tons of ways we already do between-subject designs. We compare men vs. women, or right handed vs left handed, or chess users vs. non-users. 

- Class: text
  Output: All three of them are group divisions. We take a random group, and divide them - half go into the group we call men, half into the group we call women. 

- Class: text
  Output: However, you'll notice that these are all groups that go without the experimenter needing to do anything. 

- Class: text
  Output: Of course, we can divide people up into groups whenever we want. 
  
- Class: text
  Output: "For example, Tajfel and colleagues (1971) asked participants to estimate the number of dots shown on a screen. Then they were told they had been placed into groups based on similar estimations (if you said 50, your group members also said 50). In reality, these two groups were simply randomly assigned, half placed in A, half in B. They then asked the individuals to  split up money between the two groups. Even on this simple group division - members of Group A gave more money to Group A than members of Group B, and vice versa. \n\n Tajfel, H., Billig, M. G., Bundy, R. P., & Flament, C. (1971).

- Class: mult_question
  Output: In that example, what was the manipulated, between-subjects, independent variable?
  AnswerChoices: Group membership;Amount of dots seen; Amount of money shared; Hair color
  CorrectAnswer: Group membership
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Group membership')

- Class: text
  Output: Between-Subjects Designs are typically done one of two ways. We can either do a Post-Test, or a Pre Test v Post Test. 

- Class: text
  Output: Post-test would be like what happened in the example above. Participants were assigned to their conditions (i.e. received the treatment) and then were tested.

- Class: text
  Output: Pre-Post is similar, but we also test their baseline. For example, we could have everyone take a statistics test, then half of the people we tested we let them sit in on this course, and the other half do not sit in on this course. Then, at the end, everyone takes the test again, and we see if taking this course improved how you understood statistics and research methods!

- Class: text
  Output: Within-Subjects is also called Repeated-Measures. In this, we compare each subject to themselves. 

- Class: text
  Output: For example, we might be interested in whether or not you test differently based on temperature, so first we bring you into a cold room and take a test, then bring you into a warm room and make you take the same test.
  
- Class: text
  Output: This is good because there is no chance person-related variation - you at time one is not different than you at time two. 

- Class: text
  Output: However, there are many reasons why sometimes Within-Subjects is not feasible. For example, if we want to test the policy implications of poverty, we can't ask people to both be in poverty for a year and then not be in poverty for a year.

- Class: text
  Output: Also, if the aim of the study becomes too obvious by doing multiple conditions, we might bias our results if the participants understand and notice the differences - they can then react to the demands posed by the experimenter or study design which is often referred to as demand characteristics. 

#30
- Class: text
  Output: A key confound that is present in a lot of within-subjects studies that needs to be controlled for is sequence effects. Sequence effects generally means exposure to one condition can influence future conditions.
  
- Class: text
  Output: This could be Practice Effects - when participants get better over time just because they are being exposed to the same questions, e.g., they learn how to use an interface. Or, they might be getting tired, and their scores may naturally go down (negative practice effects).
  
- Class: text
Output: There are also Carryover Effects - where the exposure to one condition is so strong it carries over to other conditions. For example, if users first interact with a highly responsive system, then a slow system, and finally a moderately responsive system, the frustration from the slow system might carry over into their evaluation of the moderately responsive system.
  
- Class: text
  Output: We try to fix these issues by counter-balancing. Maybe some people receive A->B->C, others B->C->A, others C->A->B, others C->B->A. etc. If we present every possible order, then it is complete counterbalancing. If we only present some, we call it partial counterbalancing. 
  
 - Class: text
  Output: For complete counterbalancing, the number of possibilities can grow very quickly. For example, if there are 5 conditions (A, B, C, D, E), complete counterbalancing would require presenting every possible order of these conditions. The total number of sequences would be 5! (5 factorial), which equals 120 different orders. For 10 conditions, the number of possible orders becomes 10! = 3,628,800, which is unfeasibly large for most experiments.

#31 - Random Sampling
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Random sampling helps ensure that our sample is
  AnswerChoices: Representative of the population;Limited to certain groups;Manipulated for different conditions;Only made up of students
  CorrectAnswer: Representative of the population
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Representative of the population')
  Hint: Think about what random sampling aims to achieve in relation to the larger population.

#32 - Between-Subjects Design
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following is a key indicator of a between-subjects design?
  AnswerChoices: All participants experience all conditions;Some participants receive one condition, others another;Participants are tested multiple times in different conditions;The conditions are randomized for each participant
  CorrectAnswer: Some participants receive one condition, others another
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Some participants receive one condition, others another')
  Hint: Between-subjects means participants are divided into groups, each experiencing only one condition.

#33 - Carryover Effects
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Carryover effects occur when
  AnswerChoices: Exposure to one condition influences responses in a later condition;All participants receive the same condition;Conditions are completely randomized;Only one condition is tested
  CorrectAnswer: Exposure to one condition influences responses in a later condition
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Exposure to one condition influences responses in a later condition')
  Hint: Think about how an experience in one condition can affect how participants respond in subsequent conditions.

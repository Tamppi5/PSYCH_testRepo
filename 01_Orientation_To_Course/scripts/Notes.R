# If we want to write a message to you, or if you want to leave a comment to yourself,
# you can do so by using hashtags, as you can see below.

# We will also provide you functional code. There will be brief comments that
# may explain what it is doing, like so:

# Using the c() function, create a list of numbers.
# Then, use the pipe operator to say "and then"
# then, call the mean() function to get its mean.
c(4,5,6)  |> mean()

# At the end of every set of notes, we will have this important line.
# It is critical that you do not delete this from this Notes.R .

# don't delete me!
